# ArmA Reforger Enhancement: Conflict save loadout

This mod enables the __Save loadout__ feature for the ArmA Reforger _Conflict_ game mode.

The mod works smart and does not break the gameplay rules. Also does not affect other game modes.

## Features

* Player can save his loadout at armories.
* Player can spawn with the saved loadout, if there is an armory at the CP.
* Player can not get an unfair advantage: 
    - Can not save other faction gear.
    - Can not save a radio backpack.
    - Can not save more than a default number of medkits.
