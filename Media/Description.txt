This mod allows players to save their loadouts in the Conflict game mode.

Features:

* Save your loadout at Armory
* Respawn with your saved loadout (if there is an Armory)

This mod is about convinience, not about gameplay advantage, so:

* It won't let you save other faction equipment
* It won't let you save a radio backpack
* It won't let you save more than a default number of medkits
